    a balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are of very

    an average random prediction and -1 an inverse prediction.  The statistic
    is also known as the phi coefficient. [source: Wikipedia]

        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : array-like or label indicator matrix
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    beta: float
        Weight of precision in harmonic mean.

    labels : array
        Integer array of labels.

    pos_label : str or int, 1 by default
        If ``average`` is not ``None`` and the classification target is binary,
        only this class's scores will be returned.

    average : string, [None, 'micro', 'macro', 'samples', 'weighted' (default)]
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise,
        unless ``pos_label`` is given in binary classification, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    fbeta_score : float (if average is not None) or array of float, shape =\
        [n_unique_labels]
        F-beta score of the positive class in binary classification or weighted
        average of the F-beta score of each class for the multiclass task.

    The precision is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fp)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fp`` the number of false positives. The precision is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample
    that is negative.

    The recall is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fn)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fn`` the number of false negatives. The recall is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.

    The F-beta score can be interpreted as a weighted harmonic mean of
    the precision and recall, where an F-beta score reaches its best
    value at 1 and worst score at 0.

    The F-beta score weights recall more than precision by a factor of
    ``beta``. ``beta == 1.0`` means recall and precision are equally important.

    The support is the number of occurrences of each class in ``y_true``.

    If ``pos_label is None`` and in binary classification, this function
    returns the average precision, recall and F-measure if ``average``
    is one of ``'micro'``, ``'macro'``, ``'weighted'`` or ``'samples'``.

    beta : float, 1.0 by default
        The strength of recall versus precision in the F-score.

    labels : array
        Integer array of labels.

    pos_label : str or int, 1 by default
        If ``average`` is not ``None`` and the classification target is binary,
        only this class's scores will be returned.

    average : string, [None (default), 'micro', 'macro', 'samples', 'weighted']
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise,
        unless ``pos_label`` is given in binary classification, this

    warn_for : tuple or set, for internal use
        This determines which warnings will be made in the case that this
        function is being used to return only one of its metrics.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------

    """Compute the recall

    The recall is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fn)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fn`` the number of false negatives. The recall is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.

    The best value is 1 and the worst value is 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like or label indicator matrix
        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : array-like or label indicator matrix
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    labels : array
        Integer array of labels.

    pos_label : str or int, 1 by default
        If ``average`` is not ``None`` and the classification target is binary,
        only this class's scores will be returned.

    average : string, [None, 'micro', 'macro', 'samples', 'weighted' (default)]
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise,
        unless ``pos_label`` is given in binary classification, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    recall : float (if average is not None) or array of float, shape =\
        [n_unique_labels]
        Recall of the positive class in binary classification or weighted
        average of the recall of each class for the multiclass task.

    The Hamming loss is the fraction of labels that are incorrectly predicted.

    Parameters

    y_true : array-like or label indicator matrix
        Ground truth (correct) labels.

    y_pred : array-like or label indicator matrix
        Predicted labels, as returned by a classifier.

    Notes
    -----
    In multiclass classification, the Hamming loss correspond to the Hamming
    distance between ``y_true`` and ``y_pred`` which is equivalent to the
    subset ``zero_one_loss`` function.

    In multilabel classification, the Hamming loss is different from the
    subset zero-one loss. The zero-one loss considers the entire set of labels
    for a given sample incorrect if it does entirely match the true set of
    labels. Hamming loss is more forgiving in that it penalizes the individual
    labels.

    The Hamming loss is upperbounded by the subset zero-one loss. When
    normalized over samples, the Hamming loss is always between 0 and 1.
