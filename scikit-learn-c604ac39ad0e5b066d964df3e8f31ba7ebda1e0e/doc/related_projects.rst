Below is a list of sister-projects, extensions and domain specific packages.

Extensions and Algorithms
-------------------------
Libraries that provide a scikit-learn like interface and can be used with scikit-learn tools.

- `pylearn2 <http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn2/>`_ A deep learning and
  neural network library build on theano with scikit-learn like interface.

- `Lightning <https://github.com/mblondel/lightning>`_ fast linear models, a
  drop in replacement for LinearSVC and SGDClassifier.

- `Seqlearn <https://github.com/larsmans/seqlearn>`_  An implementation of
  linear chain conditional random fields respecting the scikit-learn interface.

- `HMMLearn <https://github.com/hmmlearn/hmmlearn>`_ Implementation of hidden
  markov models that was previously part of scikit-learn.

- `PyStruct <https://pystruct.githup.io>`_ General conditional random fields
  and structured prediction.


Related Packages
----------------
Other packages useful for data analysis and machine learning.

- `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_ Tools for working with heterogeneous and
  columnar data, relational queries, time series and basic statistics.

- `theano <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/>`_ A CPU/GPU array
  processing framework geared towards deep learning research.

- `Statsmodel <http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/>`_ Estimating and analysing
  statistical models. More focused on statistical tests and less on prediction
  than scikit-learn.
