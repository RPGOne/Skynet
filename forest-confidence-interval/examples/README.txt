Examples
=========

The examples use data from standard machine learning libraries to demonstrate
how `sklforestci` can be used to calculate error bars on
:class:`RandomForestRegressor` and :class:`RandomForestClassifier` objects. The
regression example uses a data-set from the `UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG>`_ with features of
different cars and their MPG. The classification example generates synthetic
data to simulate a task like that of a spam filter: classifying items into one
of two categories (e.g., spam/non-spam) based on a number of features.
